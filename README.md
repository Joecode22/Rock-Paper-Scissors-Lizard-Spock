# Rock Paper Scissors, Lizard, Spock

This program is an implementation of the slightly more complex version of the traditional game of Rock Paper Scissors. The additional choices of Lizard and Spock add a fun twist and require a bit more strategy than the classic game.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile the program, ensure you have a C++ compiler like g++. Then run:
```
    g++ -o RPSLS RPSLS.cpp
```
To execute the program, simply run:
```
    ./RPSLS
```
## How to Play

When prompted, enter a number corresponding to your chosen move:

1. Rock ‚úä
2. Paper ‚úã
3. Scissors ‚úåÔ∏è
4. Lizard ü¶é
5. Spock üññ

The computer will randomly select its move, and the winner will be decided based on the classic rules, which are extended for Lizard and Spock.
